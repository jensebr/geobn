Bayesian network inference over geospatial data.

![geobn demo](docs/assets/demo.gif)

> **Under development** — the API is functional and tested, but may change before a stable 1.0 release.

`geobn` lets you turn heterogeneous data sources (offline and real-time) into insight over geographical areas by using techniques in probabilistic AI. The library is domain-agnostic, and may be used for, e.g., environmental risk assessment and risk‑informed route planning.

This is achieved by wiring different data sources — rasters, remote APIs, or plain scalars — directly into a Bayesian network, and run pixel-wise inference, producing posterior probability maps and entropy rasters. Under the hood it uses disk caching of remote data and groups pixels by unique evidence combinations, so each inference query is solved once per combination instead of once per pixel, keeping computations of large areas computationally tractable.

## Install

> **PyPI release coming soon.** Until then, install directly from source (Python ≥ 3.13 required):

```bash
uv pip install git+https://github.com/jensebr/geobn.git
```

To also run the bundled examples, clone the repo instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jensebr/geobn.git
cd geobn
uv pip install -e ".[full]"
```

## How it works

```
DataSources  →  align to grid  →  discretize  →  BN inference  →  InferenceResult
```

1. **Load a BN** — `geobn.load("model.bif")` reads a standard `.bif` file via pgmpy.
2. **Attach sources** — each evidence node gets a `DataSource`. All sources are reprojected and resampled to a common grid at inference time (first georeferenced source sets the grid, or call `bn.set_grid()` explicitly).
3. **Discretize** — `set_discretization(node, breakpoints, labels)` bins continuous raster values into the discrete states your BN expects.
4. **Infer** — unique evidence combinations are batched; pgmpy `VariableElimination` runs once per unique combo, not once per pixel.
5. **Pre-compute (optional)** — call `bn.precompute(query)` once before inference to exhaustively run `VariableElimination` across every possible combination of evidence states and store the results in a lookup table. Subsequent `bn.infer()` calls then reduce to a single array-index operation per pixel — no pgmpy at runtime at all. This is particularly valuable in real-time or interactive applications where the same BN is queried repeatedly with changing spatial data (e.g. updated weather inputs), because the combinatorial explosion is bounded by the number of discrete states, not by the number of pixels or API calls.
6. **Export** — `InferenceResult` gives you a numpy array, an xarray Dataset, or a multi-band GeoTIFF (N probability bands + entropy).

## Examples

| Example | Description |
|---|---|
| [`examples/lyngen_alps/`](examples/lyngen_alps/) | Avalanche risk: real Kartverket DTM + configurable weather, Lyngen Alps, Norway |

Run from the repo root:

```bash
uv run python examples/lyngen_alps/run_example.py
```

## Quick start

```python
import geobn
from pathlib import Path

# Load a Bayesian network from a .bif file
bn = geobn.load(Path("avalanche_risk.bif"))

# Attach data sources to evidence nodes
# slope_angle and aspect are derived from a real Kartverket DEM (see the example)
bn.set_input("slope_angle", geobn.ArraySource(slope_deg,    crs="EPSG:4326", transform=transform))
bn.set_input("aspect",      geobn.ArraySource(north_facing, crs="EPSG:4326", transform=transform))
bn.set_input("recent_snow", geobn.ConstantSource(30.0))   # 30 cm snowfall
bn.set_input("temperature", geobn.ConstantSource(-5.0))   # -5°C

# Define breakpoints for continuous → discrete conversion
bn.set_discretization("slope_angle", [0, 25, 40, 90],   ["gentle", "steep", "extreme"])
bn.set_discretization("aspect",      [0.0, 0.5, 1.5],   ["favorable", "unfavorable"])
bn.set_discretization("recent_snow", [0, 10, 25, 150],  ["light", "moderate", "heavy"])
bn.set_discretization("temperature", [-40, -8, -2, 15], ["cold", "moderate", "warming"])

# Run pixel-wise inference
result = bn.infer(query=["avalanche_risk"])

probs = result.probabilities["avalanche_risk"]  # (H, W, 3) — one band per state
ent   = result.entropy("avalanche_risk")        # (H, W)    — Shannon entropy in bits

# Export
result.to_xarray()          # xarray Dataset  (no rasterio needed)
result.to_geotiff(out_dir)  # multi-band GeoTIFF (requires geobn[io])
```
